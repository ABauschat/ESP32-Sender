Code for the ESP32 'Sender Device' – This device can be controlled by, and send display information to, a connected ESP32 running the 'Remote Control' device code. The sender device's MAC address should initially be read using the RX/TX ports or manually input from the terminal monitor using the 'Remote Control' interface, and then saved on an NFC chip for quick future access. Every time the remote control wants to connect with the sender device, simply scan the corresponding NFC tag, and the sender will automatically start in the menu state once connected. A state factory handles state switching, and the default state that the ESP32 boots into is the menu state, which has minimal dependencies and is intended to be almost as easy to program as the default ESP32 program. Wireless transmission of display signals is made easier by implementing a display utils class that can be interfaced with like any standard display utils class and handles the wireless transmission in the background (currently still blocking on the sender side). Wireless transmission and reception of controls is also handled very simply—you can interface with any events through an event handler, which will add any new events to a queue. This should make coding the sender device as seamless as possible, almost as if everything is being processed on-device.
